# Switch My Slot

Switch My Slot is an Ubuntu Touch app that helps you switch between android A/B system slots. You can switch to the inactive slot and boot from the alternate system. This comes in handy if you are debugging your device or simply dualbooting. This app saves you from the hassle of needing to use ssh/terminal/TWRP.
